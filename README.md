# Vitomu
Vitomu stands for **VI**deo **TO** **MU**sic converter. It allows easy conversion of online and offline videos to audio files. Just drop a URL or a local video file on the target to start the conversion. The current version supports dropping URL's of Youtube videos, and dropping of local MKV and MP4 files. The output format is currently MP3, but more output options are planned for the next version.
